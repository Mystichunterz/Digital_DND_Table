# Digital DND Table v1.0.1

This project is a digital DND table that allows players to keep track of their character sheets digitally. The project is built using React and Vite.

Currently, it is a small project meant for personal use in my DnD campaign to address some pain points I have with the available online tools. The project is still in development, and I plan to add more features as I continue to work on it.

Heavy inspiration is taken from Baldur's Gate 3, ain terms of UI design and functionality. Many of the icons are directly taken from the BG3 wiki.
